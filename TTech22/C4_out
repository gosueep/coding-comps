You are the best around. Obviously, we wanted this to be a somewhat tricky message.
Unfortunately, for the bad guys you got through it in a flash!
What else could we possible do with such a skillset? I think you will be a great asset to
the team. Nothing with stop you and your programming prowess.
Caesar ciphers were created around one hundred BC. Obviously, Julius Caesar
himself used them to send secret messages across the field. Now this was quite the
strategic advantage for him! Granted, it can take a bit of time to solve by hand.
Realistically, it is not much of an encryption these days. Anyone with coding skills and
a little bit of time can solve these relatively quickly. Do you think history will have a
favorable lens on our most recent cryptography techniques? Ultimately, the point of it
all is to keep your secrets to yourself and those you trust. Loads of people have
secrets to keep. Altogether though, you have passed our test and we are thrilled to have
you. Thank you for your time and your skillset. I doubt anyone could be a better fit for
our agency. Once you have finished up here be sure to proceed to the next question. Nothing
is quite as fun as a few programming questions! See you next time.
